# Challenges
The most challenging part was encoutnering an issue with user access to mongodb through atlas.  The original user I made wasn't working, however, making another user with the same parameters worked.  Not sure what the issue was, but this was the fix for the issue.  

# Future Development 
In the future I would like to add the following features: 

- User login to track individual progress. 
- Add calories burned 
- Make workout plans
- Add workouts to calendar
- Compete with other users.
